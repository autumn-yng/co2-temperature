# The correlation between the change in atmospheric CO2 concentration and global temperature.
# Using Python for data manipulation and visualization

## Motivation
I started this project because I wanted to learn how to use Python to work on some real data that could contribute to climate science. Climate justice has  been my passion for many years, and therefore when I started learning how to code last year, I had a hope that one day I could use my Computer Science knowledge and skills to develop something that could help our climate situation. This personal project, though small, is the first milestone on that journey of mine.

## What I've learned
This project is an opportunity for me to get to know many new tools which I don't get to learn in my college courses. I learned about several Python libraries for data science for the first time, among which **pandas** and **matplotlib** have been the ones I spent most time digging into. I practiced writing code and markdown in Jupyter Notebook which I'd never used before. Reading climate science research papers and articles efficiently, searching for reliable data sources, and planning different phases of the project are also a few of the important skills I've learned throughout this project.

## Acknowledgement
This project is inspired by the conversations I had with my mentor Huy Le, a PhD student majoring in geophysics at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University. Without his prompts, feedback, as well as encouragement, the project wouldn't get where it is today.
